## Overview
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current dayâ€™s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned
For the `Chart.js`, you have to critally learn the Library for proper use of the concepts, and below is some of the code ðŸŽ‰ that I learnt for the whole process.

```js
Chart.defaults.borderColor = '#fff';

// SetUp Block

const numbers = [17.45, 34.91, 52.36, 31.07, 23.39, 43.28, 25.48];
const data = {
  labels: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thur', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'],
  datasets: [{
    label: 'Amount of Cash',
    data: numbers,
    borderRadius: 5,
    backgroundColor: [
      '#ec755d',
      '#ec755d',
      '#76B5BC',
      '#ec755d',
      '#ec755d',
      '#ec755d',
      '#ec755d',
    ],
  }],
};

// Tooltip title
const titleTooltip = (tooltipItems) => `Â£${numbers[tooltipItems[0].dataIndex]}`;

const labelTooltip = () => '';
// Configuring the chart
const config = {
  type: 'bar',
  data,
  options: {
    onHover: (event, chartElement) => {
      if (event.native) {
        event.native.target.style.cursor = chartElement[0] ? 'pointer' : 'default';
      }
    },
    plugins: {
      tooltip: {
        yAlign: 'bottom',
        displayColors: false,
        titleMarginBottom: 0,
        backgroundColor: '#382314',
        borderColor: '#fff',
        borderWidth: 0.5,
        callbacks: {
          title: titleTooltip,
          label: labelTooltip,
        },
      },
      legend: {
        display: false,
      },
    },
    scales: {
      y: {
        beginAtZero: true,
        ticks: {
          display: false,
        },
        grid: {
          drawTicks: false,
          drawBorder: false,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```
